# Final Project

## Theme:

derivations Type B - transferable to other problems.

- B,C have extra credit
- Use any code already written
- focus: Reading input files
- Keep Track of the resources
- Final Report on the material
  - hands off deliverables
  - choose
  - However there are some things needed
  - define all, report should be self contained
  - relavant figures
    - captions
    - each figure should be referenced at somepoint in the text
  - describe the functions (math) and how it relates to the code
  - summary/conclusion
- Lang: Fortran and Python ?

## Type A : N body Problem ODE

- Continuation of hw 2
- discussing extensions to the code for more dim and more particles
- this will cover both
- no extra credit because you can use the code from the hw
- input file module will be given
- for 3 particles have only a few solns - chaotic system
  - one specical soln, specific IC's, will give a stable figure 8 orbit
  - locally stable limit cycle
- One for 4 particles
- half fortran / half python
- python
  - used for reading and plotting

## Type B: IVP, Fermi Pasta Ulam Tsingo problem ODE

- Frotran + Pythnon
- Tsingo: woman added later, was responsible for the programming
  - maniac machine
- Masses on spings, with a non linear part
  - linear : masses moveing
  - nonlinear: statistical analysis
  - looking into the PDE, ...?
- divide up into subroutines
- driver program to set up the solutions etc. etc.
- Guided questions
- Animation?
  - thermolizaton
  - quasi periodic
  - extra credit part looks for the modes present as a functoin of time
  - the modes will eventually be periodic for a bit

## Type C: Numerical PDE Advection and diffusion

- Good for fluid dynamics
- advetion: transport equation
- diffusion: spreading out
- something will be moved and diffused over time
- $au_x$ transport term
- $u_{xx}$ diffusion
