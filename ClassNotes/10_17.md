# 10-17

- python: object orient
- default types:
  - numerics, seq, mapping, classes, instances, exceptions
  - we focus on sequences
- look up doc strings
  - let's you write documentation as you write code
- immutable

  - tuples are, lists are not
    - tuples do not allow reassinment
    - cannot be modified in code
  - number assignment
    - redefining "letting x=y" will also give the same `id()`
    - numbers get completly overwritten

- mutable

  - lists are
    - they can be redefined as the same instance
  - to inspect use `id()` function
    - this gives the address in memory

- `if __name__ == "__main__":`
  - internal variables
  - these are special varaiable set by interpreter
  - **main** : called by the script
  - but if we call it and you get the predefined name then it will indicate you called it from a module
  - it is a script vs. module
  - but modules... should have this defined somewhere but it doesn't have to be
- name spaceing
  - import module
  - module.usedef('input')
  - always call the module . the thing you want
-
