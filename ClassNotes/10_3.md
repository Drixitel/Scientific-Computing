## Generic Notes

> `Formula Translator = Fortran`

- main one we will use:  `Fortran 90`
  - fortran77 is not going  to be used
- Check out:
  - Class links on the manual and quickstart
- Why Fortran?
  - plenty use it
  - helpful to read/parse through it
  - industry: Academia
  - good at taking large data
- Fortran is a Complile Language
  - not an interpreted language like python
  - gfortran I have 9.4.0, prof has 12.2.0s
  - until an issue comes up let's assume nothing wrong will happen
  - `This means the code compiles all at once rather than line by line`
- File extensions in Frotran
  - `.f(number)` will be a modern free format fortran
  - `.f`, `.ftn` will be the old fortran
  > to fix this, just make ALL files `.f90`
  - lowercase `.f`: is fortran
  > `.F` will get a preprocessing stage
  - things that have:
    - #include etc etc like C, C++
    - fortran `.f` does not know what to do with `#` commands, only `.F`
    - but we will not deal with this

## Fortran Flags

- don't use the double prec. commands
  - just add them manually in code

> `-c`

- creates a machine readable file but not an excecutable i.e

- it creates an object file. There is one here called `ifelse1.o`

- we can then use the `-o` command on the object file and create an excecutable
