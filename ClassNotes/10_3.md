- Formula Translator
- main ref Fortran 90
- Check out the quick start
- why Fortran?
  - plenty use it
  - helpful to read/parse through it
  - industry: Academia
  - good at taking large dat
- compiler
  - gfortran I have 9.4.0, prof has 12.2.0s
- Files
  - .f(number) will be a modern free format fortran
  - .f, .ftn will be the old fortran
  - to fix this, just make ALL files `.f90`
  - lowercase .f, is fortran
  - .F will get a preprocessing stage
    - things that have,
    - #include etc etc like C, C++
    - fortran does not know what to do with #, only .F
    - but we will not deal with this
