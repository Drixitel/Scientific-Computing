- Files
  - .f(number) will be a modern free format fortran
  - .f, .ftn will be the old fortran
  - to fix this, just make ALL files `.f90`
  - lowercase .f, is fortran
  - .F will get a preprocessing stage
    - things that have,
    - #include etc etc like C, C++
    - fortran does not know what to do with #, only .F
    - but we will not deal with this
